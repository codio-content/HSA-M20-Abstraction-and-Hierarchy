# Converting from Binary to Decimal numbers

While computer commands are specific sequences of binary numbers, the most tangible way we can understand binary numbers is to look at how ordinary numbers are converted to binary.

In base 10 numbers, we have a column for 1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s, etc.  These columns can also be expressed as 10 raised to increasing powers $10^0$, $10^1$, $10^2$, $10^3$, etc.  This is why we call decimal numbers base 10. 

The same can be done with any base system we choose.  In the case of binary numbers, it is base 2.  These numbers are $2^0$ , $2^1$, $2^2$, etc. which means we have a column for 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, etc.  In base 2 we only have two possible numbers, a 0 or a 1 so each column is either there or not there (1 or 0).

Therefore, a binary number 1011 has a 1 in the 8s, 2s, and 1s column.  We add to get 8 + 2 + 1 = 11 in base 10.
