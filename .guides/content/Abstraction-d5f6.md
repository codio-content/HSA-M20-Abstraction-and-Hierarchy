# Abstraction Example
If we wanted to make a new social media app, like Facebook or Twitter, we would need to solve many problems however there are many we would simply abstract away.  We wouldn't need to worry how our data travels through the complicated set of routers, hubs, and wires to reach its destination.  We only have to make our application and leave the transmission of data to the other systems.
