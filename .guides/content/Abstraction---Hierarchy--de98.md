## Abstraction
Abstractions allows programmers to take parts of a problem that would be complicated and “not worry about it”.  That is not to say that problems are not solved but in Computer Science, we break big problems down into smaller problems and once the smaller problems are solved, we don’t worry about them much anymore.  This leaves programmers free to think about the new problems or to solve a complex problem without worrying about every element of the solution.

### Example
When you drive a car, it doesn’t matter if the car is gas powered or electric.  As long as the controls are the same, the nuance of how the engine works and how the car actually works is abstracted away from your experience of driving.  That is not to say that engines are not important, they are extremely important in a car, they are just not terribly important to the driver.  As long as it works as expected, the driver does not worry about the exact manner in which the engine works.
