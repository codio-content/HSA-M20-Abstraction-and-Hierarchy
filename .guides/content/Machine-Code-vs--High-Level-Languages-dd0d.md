# Machine Code
Computers can only understand 0s and 1s.  Ultimately all information, instructions, and computer output can be broken down into this most basic system.

How do we tell a computer what to do?

Certain sequences of 0s and 1s are understood by a computer as an instruction, it may tell the computer to add the next two numbers, or store a value to a given memory address.  Rather than memorize these machine language commands, Computer Scientists have created “High Level Programming Languages” that more closely resemble human language.  

# High Level Languages
High Level Languages are either compiled or interpreted by a computer program that ultimately results in the binary code understood by computers.  The method of conversion from high level to machine level code affects the speed of the final program but all information is ultimately broken down to 0s and 1s.

The ultimate beauty of this process is that this process is abstracted and a programmer does not think or worry about the binary form of their work.  Focusing instead on the problem their program solves.
